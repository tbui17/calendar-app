Displays calendar events from the Google Calendar API in a table for users to view or update events.

Table has much functionality related to filtering, sorting, or data rearrangement. More advanced features from the enterprise version of AG Grid will be included once funding for them is obtained, or completely replace with [Prime React Table](https://primereact.org/datatable/).

This application is a work in progress and will probably take a year or two to complete, but is fully functional at this time.
