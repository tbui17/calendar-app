Displays calendar events from the Google Calendar API in a table for users to view or update events.

Table has much functionality related to filtering, sorting, or data rearrangement. More advanced features from the enterprise version of [AG Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/react-data-grid/tool-panel-columns/) will be included once funding for them is obtained, or completely replace with [Prime React Table](https://primereact.org/datatable/)

This application is a work in progress and will probably take a year or two to complete, but is fully functional at this time.

Upcoming updates:
- Create and delete events
- Debug cause of production deployment failures in backend code to re-enable server-side OAuth flow and database access
- Date input validation


- Show google tasks in sidebar
- Upgrade to Ag Grid Enterprise or replace with Prime React Table and implement:
    - Show/hide columns
    - Detailed edit view
    - Conditional row coloring based on event type
    - Recurring events
    - Save current table filters and sorting to user's profile
    - Right click context menu options
